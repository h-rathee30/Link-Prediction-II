# Link-Prediction-II
Link prediction is to predict whether there will be links between two nodes based on the attribute information and the observed existing link information. Link prediction not only can be used in the field of social network but can also be applied in other fields. As in bioinformatics, link prediction can be used to discover interactions between proteins; in the field of electronic commerce, link prediction can be used to create the recommendation system; and in the security field, link prediction can help to find the hidden terrorist criminal gangs. Link prediction is closely related to many areas. 
To improve the stability and accuracy of link prediction, I assemble the three similarity indexes (i.e. CN, LHN-II and MFI) and introduce the idea of stacking into the link prediction of complex networks. First, based on Logistic regression algorithm and an Xgboost algorithm, I take three similarity indexes as the three characteristics to be learned by the models. Next, I use cross-validation, grid searching and early-stopping methods to determine the hyperparameters of these models.
